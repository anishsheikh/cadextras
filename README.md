SMIC180/icc.rules --> IC Custom router rules which were not included in various forums in chinese forums where i got it from. so i ported it and fixed the parameters a bit to work with it , still in beta, can't be used in anything great.

kernels.hip, kernels.hiph, ops.hip, ops.hiph --> latest bitsandbytes cuda code ported and compilation errors mitigated. logic isn't tested yet. needs to be fixed with cmake or 
make and python scripts. adding here because i might not continue it, becaause the code is not well organized and maintainablity is complicated because even tho the code is good enough as logic but complicated to maintain it without some sort of Frontend-Backend code API abstraction. 
Doesn't use miopen or  migraphx. so might be possible to compile and work on windows also.
